Example files to show how to use Xcode templates with your own custom settings

This is the code used for one of my Youtube tutorials. You can watch it here: https://youtu.be/r9rdbrpRNcY

## How to use these templates

- Download templates
- open the Folder app 
- Go to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode
- Create Templates folder if you don't already have one
- move templates into Templates folder
- close Xcode and restart (you might need to restart you mac to see all the correct changes)
- create new Xcode project and choose one of you new templates

If you create a new Project with the SwiftUI app template, you should have the same project setup as the TestProject attached to this repository.
